            3 Types of Errors
            Syntax: --> Error in the "spelling".
                int x = 45 --> No semicolon. 
            Runtime: --> Program begins but crashes or throws an error later on in the program.
                Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
                int Candy = 100;
                int howmany;
                System.out.print("How many people are you giving candy to? > ");
                howmany = s.nextInt();
                int eachgets = candy/howmany // Could crash or throw an error depending on the answer to this line.
                System.out.println("Each person gets " + eachgets);
            Logic: --> Program works properly but something is wrong with it. Hardest issue to detect in a program.
                System.out.println("Enter wage/hr > ");
                double wage = s.nextDouble();
                System.out.println("Enter hours worked: ");
                double hours = s.nextDouble();
                double pay = wage + hours;
                System.out.println("Your pay is " + pay);
